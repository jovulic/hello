# hello

_A collection of hello world nix flakes._

## 📌 Description

A variety of "Hello World!" implementations in a variety of languages. The repository largely exists to just practice some `nix` related packaging configuration, along with structure related configuration (such as nested flakes).

## 🛠️ Build

We can build any of the sub-projects with `nix build` and run them with `nix run`.
